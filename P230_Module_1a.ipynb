But for a computer, especially a modern computer, this is a piece of cake.  In order to do this sort of thing, it's often appropriate to use a **loop**.  In Python, there are two main kinds of loops that one might generally find useful: **for loops**, which tell Python to repeat a certain code block according to a pre-specified list of steps, and **while loops** which tell Python to repeat a code block as long as a certain condition evaluates to true.\n","\n","As an example of a simple `for` loop, let's tell the interpreter to add all of the numbers from 1 to 4:"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"bNwwUpkG7h3F","outputId":"28dc7e8c-f518-4809-d8a4-7780c7cc936e"},"source":["total = 0\n","\n","for n in range(5):\n","    total += n\n","\n","print(total)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["10\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"E6VXfRl57h3H"},"source":["Here's what happened in that cell:\n","\n","1.

We have already encountered certain functions that are built into Python.  For example, we have seen that the `type` function takes some Python object (like an int or float) as its input and outputs what sort of object it is.  The `print` function takes some python expression as its input, and outputs the value of that expression.  There are lots of other functions built into Python that you can explore here, but we now want to discuss how a user can write their own Python functions.\n","\n","## Why use functions in the first place?\n","\n","Among the most important motivations for writing your own Python functions is the goal of writing **modular** code.  This means writing code that comes in reasonably small pieces, each of which performs a specific task.  There are any advantages to writing modular code, among the most important are:\n","\n","1. If code is modular, then each segment of the code can be individually developed and dubugged before being used in an entire program.  This way, if the program isn't working properly, one can be reasonably certain that the properly debugged piece of code is not the culprit.\n","2. If code is modular, then one can separate what a certain segment of code does from the precise implementation -- the way in which it accomplishes its tasks.  This means that if at a future date, one finds a better way of achieving that task, one needs only change an isolated piece of code with the new implementation instead of writing the whole thing over again.\n","3. Writing modular code makes it easier to plan and explain the logic of the code.  By breaking the code up into small pieces, each of which performs a specific function, one can focus on implementing each piece of code one at a time once the logic is layed out as opposed to having to think about the entire code all the time.  Also, when someone is trying to understand the code, they don't necessarily need to understand every line to get what it's doing, they'll just need to understand how all the various smaller pieces fit together.  If they want to delve into the nitty gritty implementation of each piece, they are free to do so, but they don't have to.\n","\n","Writing your own functions is a specific way of making code modular.  A function is an object that takes in certain inputs, does something potentially complicated to these inputs, and then returns an output.  By writing a function to perform a task, you can use this function to perform that task again and again without having to copy and paste the full code for each instance of the task.\n","\n","## User-defined functions\n","\n","In Python, defining a function is extremely easy and intuitive.
