    "    *Hint*: We'd like to do this for *any* value of the mass $m$. Sometimes you'll find that it's more useful to plot a **dimensionless ratio** than the actually physical quantity itself. In this case, we can plot the ratios of the kinetic energies to the rest energy ($K_N/E_0$ and $K_r/E_0$); notice that the $m$ cancels from both of these expressions. Conveniently, since these ratios are dimensionless, there's no units to worry about on your axes. Similarly, this is why we'll use $v/c$ rather than $v$ for the x-axis. \n",
